# Inspirations behind the library
I'd be lying if I didn't have inspirations behind this library. The main ones being [cgmath](https://github.com/rustgd/cgmath/tree/master), [glam-rs](https://github.com/bitshifter/glam-rs/) and from *C++*: [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm). I mainly made this library for fun, and to learn some linear algebra and math with imaginary numbers.

I want this library to have every facet of math, from **geometry, linear algebra and trigonometry** and maybe even **group theory, complex math, fractals even**. That will
probably take a long time, and even though Im doing this for fun I want it to be the best it can be.
